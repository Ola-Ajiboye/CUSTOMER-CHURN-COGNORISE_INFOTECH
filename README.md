# CUSTOMER CHURN ANALLYSIS
## OBJECTIVE
This project is to Identify key factors influencing customer churn and retention in the tour and travel industry
## AGE
### INSIGHS
Age 28, are more likely to church. This suggest that this age group might have specific needs or expectations that aren’t being met. Focusing on personalized engagement, targeted promotions, or better understanding their preferences could help reduce church.
Additionally, the fact that that older age group like 30 and above have lower churn rates might indicate they find more value or have different usage patterns, understanding these differences can help tailor your strategies for each segment.
## FREQUENT FLYERS
### INSIGHT
#### For frequent flyers with High church
•	Loyalty Programs: introduce points-based rewards for repeat bookings or referrals.
•	Exclusive Perks: Offer priority boarding, lounge access, or discounts on premium packages.
•	Personalized Recommendations: Use data to suggest relevant destination based on past travel history.
#### For non-frequent flyers with low church
•	Upselling Opportunities: encourage additional bookings with limited time deals or bundled packages.
•	Long Term Engagement: Keep them connected with newsletters, destination highlights, or off-season discounts.
## HOTEL BOOKING
###INSIGHTS
•	Among customers who booked hotels, a majority are non-churned customers (330 out of 378), indicating that hotel booking are more common among loyal customers.
•	For churned customers, a significant portion (176 out of 224) did not book hotels, suggesting a potential correlation between not booking hotels and churn.
•	Among non-churned customers, more people booked hotels (330) compared to those who did not (400), which might imply that hotel booking can be a positive indicator of customer retention.
## CUSTOMER INCOME CLASS
### INSIGHTS
#### CUSTOMER DISTRIBUTION
Middle income customers form the largest group (409 out of 954), followed by low-income customers (386) and high-income customers (159).
#### CHURN VS NON-CHURNED
High income customers have a relatively balanced distribution, with 92 showing (engaged) and 67 not showing (churned). This suggests a higher engagement rate compared to other income groups.
Middle income customers have 98 showing, while a significant majority (381) did not show. Tis indicates potential dissatisfaction or disengagement in this group.
Low income customers show higher engagement (104 showing) but also have a substantial number (282) not showing.
#### ENGAGEENT INSIGHTS
High income customers seem more engaged likely due to higher spending power or greater perceived value, focus on maintaining their loyalty through exclusive benefits.
Middle income customers have the lowest engagement rate. Investigate their needs and pain points, as this group may require targeted interventions to boost retention.
Low income customers show moderate engagement but also significant churn. Offering affordable packages or loyalty rewards might improve their retention.
